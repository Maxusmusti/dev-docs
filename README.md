# Instruct Lab Architecture

This repository contains design artifacts that define the architecture and
design of cross-component interactions in the Instruct Lab project.

## Formatting Guidelines

Design documents should be placed in `docs/`.

### Text

Files should be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format.

### Images

Diagrams are encouraged, but must be submitted in a format where they can be
easily updated in the future as needed. Some options include:

* [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme)
* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
** Be sure to leave "Embed Scene" turned on when exporting the PNG.
